## Problem Statement  
For groups of people (friends, family, etc.) who enjoy democracy and need to make a quick decision, this project provides a voting system that helps when:  
- The vote of the group is unclear.  
- Some members may not feel comfortable voicing their preferences openly.  

This project makes decision-making more inclusive, efficient, and accessible.  

## Technologies Used  
This project is built using:  
- **Frontend:** JavaScript with Vue.js  
- **Backend & Hosting:** Amazon Web Services (AWS)  
- **Additional Tools & Libraries:**  
  - Axios  
  - Babel  
  - ESLint  
  - NPM  
  - BEM CSS  
  - SCSS  
  - Vue Router  
  - Vue Mixins  
  - Vue Composables  
- **Database:** MongoDB (to store votes, polls, and analyze large datasets for insights on specific topics)  

## Goals & Timeline  
- **Minimal Viable Product (MVP):** A working framework with core functionality, designed to be easily expandable, within the next **4 weeks**.  
- **Future Improvements:** Expanding features and refining the user experience beyond the initial release.
### 3/19
- Have a design and plan for the timeline of this project.
### 3/26
- Have AWS and domain up with simple hello world page.
### 4/2
- Layout and framework of the application in place.
### 4/9
- Functionality on some of the pages, database configured and uploaded with recent data on certain topics.
### 4/16
- Functioning minimally with recents (database) page as well as being able to create a poll, vote on a poll, and search the different topics available.
## Feasibility of Goals  
While the 4-week timeline is ambitious, I will do my best to meet it. If more time is needed, I am open to adjusting the schedule to ensure quality.  

## Motivation  
I am pursuing this project to:  
- Gain hands-on experience with the technologies I will use during my upcoming **internship** while also using what I have learned in CS 452 Databases class.  
- Improve my database skills as well as my **Vue.js** and full-stack development skills.
- Create a useful tool that enhances group decision-making.
