# Poll Party Project  

## Purpose
A web application built with Javascript, Vue, and other tools that enables users to create polls and have others vote on those polls anonymously. The main purpose of this is to help groups of friends, family, etc. vote on a decision.

## Problem Statement  
For groups of people (friends, family, etc.) who enjoy democracy and need to make a quick decision, this project provides a voting system that helps when:  
- The vote of the group is unclear.  
- Some members may not feel comfortable voicing their preferences openly.  

This project makes decision-making more inclusive, efficient, and accessible.  

## Technologies Used  
This project is built using:  
- **Frontend:** JavaScript with Vue.js  
- **Backend & Hosting:** Amazon Web Services (AWS)  
- **Additional Tools & Libraries:**  
  - Axios  
  - Babel  
  - ESLint  
  - NPM  
  - BEM CSS  
  - SCSS  
  - Vue Router  
  - Vue Mixins  
  - Vue Composables  
- **Database:** MongoDB (to store votes, polls, and analyze large datasets for insights on specific topics)  

## Goals & Timeline  
- **Minimal Viable Product (MVP):** A working framework with core functionality, designed to be easily expandable, within the next **4 weeks**.  
- **Future Improvements:** Expanding features and refining the user experience beyond the initial release.
### 3/19
- Have a design and plan for the timeline of this project.
### 3/26
- Have AWS and domain up with simple hello world page.
### 4/2
- Layout and framework of the application in place.
### 4/9
- Functionality on some of the pages, database configured and uploaded with recent data on certain topics.
### 4/16
- Functioning minimally with recents (database) page as well as being able to create a poll, vote on a poll, and search the different topics available.
## Feasibility of Goals  
While the 4-week timeline is ambitious, I will do my best to meet it. If more time is needed, I am open to adjusting the schedule to ensure quality.  

## Motivation  
I am pursuing this project to:  
- Gain hands-on experience with the technologies I will use during my upcoming **internship** while also using what I have learned in CS 452 Databases class.  
- Improve my database skills as well as my **Vue.js** and full-stack development skills.
- Create a useful tool that enhances group decision-making.
